# mysql-metadata - ORM for mysql's information_schema

sqlalchemy model for mysql's information schema
this should be used in a read-only manner

The model is forced to manually specify a primary key
for each table, as this is a requirement of sqlalchemy.
MySQL's information_schema lacks foreign keys and primary keys,
so the tables don't always suit this way of doing things.
